# Lisp Interpreter

Project implementing an interpreter for Lisp commands. Implemented in C++.
# Installation

Simply run the Makefile to compile and use the interpreter. I only used standard header files for this project so it should run on most platforms.

# Interpreter Capabilities
Supports several Lisp operations such as 
* car 
* cdr
* define
* literals
* boolean evaluation
* conditionals
* variable declaration and assignment 
* arithmetic operations such as + - / *
* function definition and calls
* safety features such as division by 0 checking
